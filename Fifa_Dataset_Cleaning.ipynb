    "Outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest of the data i.e a data point that is far away from the average.\n",
    "It reduces the power of statistical tests. Machine learning algorithms do not work well in the presence of outlier. So, it is desirable to detect and remove outliers.\n",
    "Deleting the outliers values is not a good idea when we have small dataset."
